# Variables in JavaScript

**NOTE!** : When creating variables, we use camelCase! meaning when declaring a variable with two words, we lowercase the first letter of word 1, and uppercase the first letter of word 2

---

- ``` let ``` is used for variables where the value will change.

How to use ``` let ``` for a variable?
```
let variableName = 123; // we declare a variable
variableName = 369; // we can change the value!
```

- ``` const ``` is used for variables where the value will remain constant

How to use ``` const ``` for a variable?
```
const bloodGroup = "O Positive"; // we deeclare a variable
bloodGroup = "B Positive"; // when this code will run, it will show error!
```
