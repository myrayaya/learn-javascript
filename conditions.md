# Conditionals in JavaScript

JavaScript program executes it line by line. But what if we want the program to execute differently and do different things? We do it using Control Flow Statements!

## Control Flow Statements:-

- ``` if ``` statement : it takes the condition and executes if it is ``` True ```, but if it is ``` False ```, it doesn't execute and the code progresses or it is executed "differently"

How to use ``` if ``` statement in JavaScript:-
```
if (Grade > 33) {
  console.log("Congratulations! You Passed!")
}
```

- ``` else ``` statement : if the condition isn't ``` True ```, the statement associated with ``` False ``` will be executed.
